# RTS Project for Tello Drone

A Tello drone is a mini drone equipped with an HD camera. It is an impressive and programmable drone which is perfect for education uses. It helps the users to learn about drones and how to control the drone by using a programming language. This tello drone also used DJI Flight technology, which is an Industry-leading component to ensure stable flights.

Apart from that, Tello App is provided by the developer to get easy with the controller and the execution of the code. Tello is also an easy, budget friendly and perfect drone for beginners to start playing with the drone technology.

The aim for this project is to analyze, design and code a real-time computer program using python programming language in order to develop a prototype of Facemask Detection System for this pandemic period. As COVID-19 hits the world, the government has implemented the Standard Operating Procedure(SOP) which requires everyone to wear a mask when visiting public spaces. As the law is being imposed, we canâ€™t ensure that everyone will follow the guidelines by the government. In this problem, Facemask Detection System was developed by using the basic facial recognition to check whether people wear a mask or not in public spaces. 

The report will begin with listing the functional requirements that have been extracted from the case study, identifying the external interfaces of the system, identifying the constraints and quality attributes, producing suitable diagrams for prototype design, explaining the implementation of the system, source code and screenshots of the system, and appendices consisting of the contract of this group project.
